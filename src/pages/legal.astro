          <h3>General Information</h3>
          <p>
            The SPS DAO (the "DAO") is a decentralized autonomous organization
            operating on blockchain technology. The information provided by the
            DAO, including but not limited to its website, whitepapers, social
            media, smart contracts, and other communications, is for informational
            purposes only and does not constitute legal, financial, tax,
            investment, or professional advice. You are solely responsible for
            consulting with qualified professionals before making any decisions
            related to your participation in or interaction with the DAO.
          </p>
          <h3>No Offer or Solicitation</h3>
          <p>
            Participation in the DAO, including any token-related activities or
            governance processes, does not constitute an offer to sell or a
            solicitation to buy any securities, financial instruments, or assets
            in any jurisdiction. The DAO's tokens (if any) are not intended to
            represent equity, shares, or ownership in any legal entity unless
            explicitly stated otherwise. Any actions you take in connection with
            the DAO are at your own risk.
          </p>
          <h3>Regulatory Compliance</h3>
          <p>
            The DAO operates in a decentralized manner and may not be registered
            or licensed with any regulatory authority. The legal status of DAOs,
            blockchain technology, and digital assets varies by jurisdiction and
            is subject to change. You are responsible for ensuring that your
            participation in the DAO complies with all applicable laws,
            regulations, and restrictions in your jurisdiction. The DAO makes no
            representations or warranties regarding its compliance with any
            specific legal or regulatory framework.
          </p>
          <h3>Risk Acknowledgment</h3>
          <p>
            Participation in the DAO, including the use of its protocols, smart
            contracts, or tokens, involves significant risks, including but not
            limited to financial loss, technological vulnerabilities, regulatory
            uncertainty, and market volatility. Blockchain technology and
            decentralized systems are experimental and may contain bugs, errors,
            or vulnerabilities. The DAO does not guarantee the security,
            functionality, or performance of its protocols or smart contracts. By
            participating, you acknowledge and accept these risks and agree that
            the DAO, its contributors, developers, or affiliates shall not be
            liable for any losses or damages arising from your participation.

          <h3>No Warranty</h3>
          <p>

            basis without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including
            but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a
            particular purpose, or non-infringement. The DAO does not guarantee
            uninterrupted access, security, or error-free operation of its
            systems.
          </p>
          <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
          <p>
            To the fullest extent permitted by law, the DAO, its contributors,
            developers, members, or affiliates shall not be liable for any
            direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages
            arising from your participation in the DAO, including but not limited
            to losses from smart contract failures, hacks, regulatory actions, or
            market fluctuations. This limitation applies regardless of whether
            the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, or any
            other legal theory.
          </p>
          <h3>Tax Obligations</h3>
          <p>
            You are solely responsible for determining and fulfilling any tax
            obligations arising from your participation in the DAO, including but
            not limited to income, capital gains, or other taxes. The DAO does
            not provide tax advice or collect tax-related information.

          <p>
            Any statements regarding the DAO's future plans, objectives, or
            performance are forward-looking and subject to risks and
            uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those
            projected. The DAO undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking
            statements.
          </p>
          <h3>Third-Party Content and Links</h3>
          <p>
            The DAO may provide links to third-party websites, services, or
            content. These are provided for convenience only, and the DAO does
            not endorse, control, or assume responsibility for any third-party
            content or services. Your interactions with third parties are at your
            own risk.
          </p>
          <h3>Jurisdictional Restrictions</h3>

            jurisdictions. By participating, you represent that you are not
            located in a jurisdiction where such participation is prohibited or

            contributors, developers, or affiliates are not responsible for the
            actions or decisions of the DAO's community or its smart contracts.
          </p>

            This disclaimer may be updated or modified at any time without prior
            notice. Continued participation in the DAO constitutes acceptance of
            the updated terms.
