          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Real-Time Monitoring:</strong> Use automated tools to flag
              transactions exceeding thresholds (e.g., cash deposits &gt;$10,000
              in the U.S.) or deviating from expected patterns.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Behavioral Analytics:</strong> Employ AI-driven tools to detect

            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Red Flags:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Multiple small deposits to avoid reporting thresholds

              Transactions with high-risk jurisdictions or sanctioned entities.

            <li>
              Inconsistent activity with the customer’s stated purpose or
              profile.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use of shell companies or complex ownership structures to obscure
              beneficial owners.

          </ul>
          <h4>6.2 Suspicious Activity Reporting</h4>

              the relevant authority (e.g., FinCEN in the U.S.) within 30 days, per

            </li>
            <li>
              Ensure records are securely stored and accessible for regulatory

            <li>
              Geographic risk (e.g., operations in FATF grey-listed countries).
            </li>
            <li>
              Product/service risk (e.g., virtual assets, cross-border
              payments).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
